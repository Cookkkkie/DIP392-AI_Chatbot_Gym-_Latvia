# DIP392 AI Chatbot for Gym! Latvia üß†üèãÔ∏è‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
This repository contains the source code for a centralized AI chatbot system designed to assist Gym Latvia clients by answering frequently asked questions and providing helpful information. It utilizes OpenAI-compatible models (via Ollama LLM), Redis for chat history management, and Spring Boot for backend API handling. The chatbot dynamically fetches FAQ data from the Gym Latvia website to stay up-to-date.
